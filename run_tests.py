def run_tests():
    """
    Runs all unit tests and generates coverage reports.
    This function performs the following steps:
    1. Starts code coverage tracking
    2. Discovers and executes all tests in the 'Tests' directory
    3. Exits with code 1 if any tests fail
    4. Generates coverage reports in both console and HTML format
    Returns:
        None
    Raises:
        SystemExit: If any tests fail (with exit code 1)
    Notes:
        - Tests are discovered automatically from the 'Tests' directory
        - HTML coverage report is generated in 'coverage_html' directory
        - Requires the 'coverage' module to be installed
