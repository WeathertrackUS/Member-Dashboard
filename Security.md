# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The WeatherTrackUS Development Team takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Vulnerability

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in the WTUS Team System, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly**
2. **Use GitHub's built-in security vulnerability reporting tool**
   - Navigate to our repository's "Security" tab
   - Select "Report a vulnerability"
   - Provide the following details:
     - Description of the vulnerability
     - Steps to reproduce the issue
     - Potential impact of the vulnerability
     - Any suggestions for mitigation or fixes

### What to Expect

After you submit a vulnerability report, you can expect:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.
2. **Verification**: Our team will work to verify the issue and may request additional information.
3. **Fix Development**: If confirmed, we'll develop a fix and test it.
4. **Disclosure**: Once a fix is ready, we'll coordinate with you on an appropriate disclosure timeline.

## Security Best Practices

We follow these security best practices in our development process:

1. **Regular Dependency Updates**: We regularly update our dependencies to include security patches.
2. **Code Review**: All code changes undergo security-focused code reviews.
3. **Authentication**: We implement secure authentication mechanisms and password policies.
4. **Data Protection**: Sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.
5. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized.

For more detailed information about our security practices, please refer to our [Security Best Practices](docs/security-best-practices.md) documentation.
